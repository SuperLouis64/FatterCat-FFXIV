# FatterCat-FFXIV
An Arduino set-up to turn your Fat Cat Cushion into a controller for FFXIV. When you sit on the fat cat, you summon the Mount in-game. That's it that's literally it! Watch the oveview video on youtube: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcHgGBZSpo0>


### Hardware Needed
This mod needs some hardware to get running. I have a full tutorial on my website if you need more information: <https://www.controllerbend.com/fatter-cat-mount.html>
- Arduino Micro: Amazon $19
- Touch Sensor: Amazon $9
- Solderless Breadboard (Optional)
- Jumper Solderless Wires: Amazon $9

### How to Set-up
Step 1: Setting up the Arduino Hardware
1. Connect your Touch sensor to the Arduino Micro.
2. Connect the Touch Sensor's VCC is connected to the 5V slot on the Arduino
3. Connect the SIG to the Digital 4 slot
4. Connect the GND to the GND on the Arduino

Step 2: Upload the Arduino Script into your Arduino
1. Visit the Github page to download the program
2. Upload it to your Arduino

Step 3: Set up your FFXIV for the Arduino
1. Put your Fatter Cat Mount (or any mount) on the Numpad 7 slot on your Hotbar
2. Place the Arduino and touch sensor on where you would sit on the Fat Cat 
3. I decided to hide it underneath some fabric so I didn't have to secure it by sewing into the Fat Cat Cushion

Step 4: Sit & Enjoy!
